I'm Matei. I've been working as a video games programmer for a tiny bit now.

But now I am looking to broaden my spectrum of knowledge.

I realise it's late, but better late than never.

Currently I am simultaneously delving into Web Dev and sharpening my C++ knowledge. 

My ultimate goal is to build things that people find useful.

To that end, I am arming myself with as much knowledge as possible.

Hopefully I'll remember to change this readme when things progress. - Dec 2022
